# Helsana-Data-Challenge-HackZurich
Workshop Winner: Recommendation System and Fraud Detection 

## Inspiration

We were quite intrigued by the current reward system that Helsana has in place, as well as with the problems they face with this program. We wanted to take advantage of the real dataset provided to add value to the customer and the company, using our favourite data analytics techniques!
What it does

This client facing web app consists of a history of the activities that the user has accomplished. To enrich this experience, we used some data analytics and statistical inference to provide recommendations on what activity the user should do next, based on their past preferences. We also mark suspicious activities uploaded as the user, which could be fraudulent, using the entire database to detect abnormal activities. Once a fraud is detected, we can deduct some points, hoping that the user would avoid providing false information in the future.

This way, we want to encourage users to be honest, as well as give them a chance to correct or provide additional proof. This mechanism promotes values of transparency and trust between the client and the company. Having an automatic way of checking potential frauds allows the system to be more scalable and sustainable in the long term, such that more clients could benefit from the program.

Apart from the main functionalities mentioned above, we also implemented a simple login page where the login form is fully validated as well.
